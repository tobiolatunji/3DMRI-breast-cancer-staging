# MMDx: Mulitmodal Detection for Breast Cancer
Combining Imaging, Genomic and Clinical Data to predict Breast cancer stage
Insight Data Science Sept-Oct 2017

Breast Cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the US costing about $16.5million per year. Most deaths are caused by late stage cancer. To prevent these deaths, screening tests should be developed that catch cancers early so that interventions can be implemented to slow the progress to late stage cancers. Staging is one such test that determines the level of progress of an existing tumour but it requires Imaging, Clinical, tissue biopsy and sometimes genomic data. An assessment (stage) is made based on the review of the results of these tests. This is obviously a cumbersome and often drawn out process. AI startups that have tried to help automate this process have focused mostly on imaging data alone or genomic data. Building a model that combines these data sources could provide more reliable and robust predictions at scale.

This project seeks to build a model that correctly predicts the stage of breast cancer (early or late) by combining Imaging, Genomic and Clinical data to improve Oncology decision support.

For the purpose of this project:

1. Early Stage (Based on Prognosis)
- Stage 1a
- Stage 1b
- Stage 2a
- Stage 2b
- Stage 3a

2. Late Stage (Based on Prognosis)
- Stage 3b
- Stage 3c
- Stage 4
